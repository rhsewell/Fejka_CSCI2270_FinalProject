# Fejka_CSCI2270_FinalProject 
How to Run:
FileDriver.cpp going to be the main for a network project. Will be able to manipulate messages and move them to desired cities in the network. The message will be user input and the network pathway will also be user input. The build network method will create a linked list of 15 predetermined city names and print the path once it is created. The print network path method will traverse the linked list and print out each or the city names in order.  The add function take the new city name and the previous city name and puts it into the linked list. The delete function takes a city name and removes it from the linked list. The store message method traverses the linked list and stores the user input message to the node. The check message method searches for the input city and retrieves the message it holds. In the transmit method the user inputs a message and it will send it through the network and then back. The targeted transmit method takes a city name and a message which will send the message through the network to the specified city and then back. The transmit and store method takes a message and a destination city and send the message through the network to the city and then stores it.
